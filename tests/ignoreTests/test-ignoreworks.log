By default ignores are usually nothing special and used to block out words like null.

This test though is mainly to ensure parsing of ignores that include escaped '"'s works as expected.
The attached conf that should be used here will sanitise anything after a ': ' like '\w: (.+)$' so this line should not be tampered.

This should be Sanitized: doNotIgnoreThis - 
This should not be Sanitized: "pleaseignore" - 
This should not be Sanitized: null - 

Stupid Test - dumbtest

Expected output is that only ignorethis is removed.
